I am engaged esport via the [AW3 brand](https://aw3.no) both as an owner and
as a coach and mental trainer for top esport contenders. This page serves as a
primer and prerequisite for those I coach and train. To engage in the
training, you need to do the following before we start:

1. Read the blog post, "[Parents; Embrace your kid's gaming](https://isene.org/2019/11/Esport.html)"
2. Watch the video, "[Mental training in eSports](https://isene.org/2020/04/eSports.html)"
3. Listen to the podcast, "[Mental Training](https://isene.org/2018/11/Podcast-MentalTraining.html)"
4. Read the OnePageBook, "[Mental training - The core](https://isene.org/onepagebooks/#1pb-2-mental-training---the-core)"
5. Listen to the podcast, "[Why mental clarity and presence give top performance](https://isene.org/2021/02/Podcast-TopPerformance.html)"
6. Listen to the podcast, "[Getting in The Zone - creating thoughts and feelings](https://isene.org/2021/05/Podcast-TheZone.html)"
7. Read the blog post, "[The RALE Scale](https://isene.org/2020/03/RALE.html)"
8. Read the article, "[Coaching and mental training](https://www.dropbox.com/s/v34py48xp9nlcu1/coaching.pdf?raw=1)"
9. Watch the video, "[Kluber ENDURES shower of sunflower seeds!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65wdkNtSJeU)"
10. Write me an e-mail (g@isene.com) explaining:
* what you got out of doing the above, and 
* what you would like to achieve with mental training
11. And finally, hook me up on Discord (isene#0199).

Recently I have acquired an apprentice that can help with professional esports
contenders. He would engage the right players for free to gain more
experience.
