Tools](https://isene.com/amar.html) you can easily generate all kinds of
random encounters - from Elves and Trolls to Dwarves, Demons, Dragons, special
magic creatures and normal folks like peasants, soldiers, prostitutes and
carpenters. You can also generate detailed Non-Player Characters, elaborate
with skills covering fighting, archery, tracking, magic, social lore and
much more. You can even create fully populated villages, towns and cities -
complete with a graphical map showing the relationship between the inhabitant.
There is also a random weather generator and name generators for the main
races of Amar as well as names for villages, towns, cities and magic items.
