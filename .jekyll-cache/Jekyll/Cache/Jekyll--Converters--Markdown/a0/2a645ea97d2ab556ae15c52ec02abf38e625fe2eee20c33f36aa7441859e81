<p>If your whole life is centered around having a perfect body, then any criticism of your body will be a criticism of your whole world. If your life is all about your job, then taking a hit at work will see your world crumble.</p>

<p>The smaller your world is, the more vulnerable you are to criticism or to someone rocking that small world.</p>

<p>Having a small world is commonly referred to as being self centered. So, bluntly put - the more sensetive you are to criticism, the more self centered you are.</p>

<p>Being self centered and having a small world is similar to running a business with only a few customers. It hurts when one customer stops buying.</p>

<p>Just like with the number of friends you have. If you only have three friends, it hurts like hell if one of them turns her back on you.</p>

<p>If you have just one line of income, you are financially more vulnerable than if you have several.</p>

<p>To get less sensitive to criticism, grow your world. Grow your interest in more areas, more people. Drown out the focus on yourself by focusing more on others.</p>

<p>But does this mean you have to become an “extrovert”? And how does this relate to being interested versus being interesting?</p>

<p>Listen to the podcast and get provoked.</p>
