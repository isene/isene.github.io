I"S<p>Few things gets me going like programming. After a rush of coding in the
beginning of the year, I found myself missing the creative intellectual
challange that programming poses. Then I found a missing application and my
geek life got new zest.</p>

<p>With three telescopes and a bunch of eyepieces, there are lots of calculations
that I want done. An eyepiece is that optical piece you put in at the end of a
telescope that determines the magnification and field of view you get.</p>

<p>There is a set of interesting properties that can be calculated for a given
telescope. And telescope/eyepiece combinations also yield a set of interesting
properties.</p>

<p>Having already made a program for the HP-41 that calculates all this, I
thought it would be cool to recreate this type of program as a
terminal/console application (for Linux, MacOS, Windows).</p>

<p>Three evenings later and “Telescope” was up on
<a href="https://github.com/isene/telescope">Github</a> and
<a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/telescope-term">Rubygems.org</a>.</p>

<p>I also did a bunch of improvements to the RTFM filemanager.</p>

<p>To make for easier installations, I started making Ruby “gems” out of my
applications. This makes it silly easy to install my set of (useful)
solutions, simply do this in a terminal:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For <a href="https://github.com/isene/telescope">Telescope</a>: <code class="highlighter-rouge">gem install telescope-term</code></li>
  <li>For <a href="https://github.com/isene/astropanel">Astropanel</a>: <code class="highlighter-rouge">gem install astropanel</code></li>
  <li>For the <a href="https://github.com/isene/RTFM">RTFM filemanager</a>: <code class="highlighter-rouge">gem install rtfm-filemanager</code></li>
  <li>For <a href="https://github.com/isene/t-rex">T-REX</a> (the RPN calculator): <code class="highlighter-rouge">gem install t-rex</code></li>
</ul>

<p>In less than 2 months, there’s now more than 8500 downloads of my RubyGems.
All free with no restrictive licenses. I like that people find them useful.</p>
