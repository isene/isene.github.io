I"K	<p>I had to get Jonatan to grow up and help me to complete this project from 1999.</p>

<p>Ever since I was a kid, I was fascinated by the <a href="https://mcescher.com/">works of</a> the Dutch artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._C._Escher">M.C. Escher</a>. His artwork is very diverse, but it was his drawings of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_object">impossible objects</a>” that caught my interest and has remained an inspiration all my life. His “Waterfall” started my fascination with dimensions and led me to explore dimesions above 3 - with me and a high school friend experimenting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Convay’s Game of Life</a> in both 4, 5 and 6 dimensions.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago I decided to make a font based on his ideas - my own tribute to the artist. With pen and pencil I jotted down a few characters based on his impossible drawings during a family vacation in Portugal. But then I got stuck and left the project. I did revisit the task several times but never got it completed before now. Jonatan has been designing and redesigning characters with me since a few days, and here it is, the font:</p>

<p>The whole character set consists of the capital letters A-Z and the numbers 0-9. We are planning to add a few more symbols like punctuation mark, hyphen, comma and a few others.</p>

<p>As you can see, the M, and W are variations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_trident">Impossible Trident</a> while the 6 and 9 contains the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_triangle">Penrose Triangle</a>.</p>

<p>You can download and freely use the TrueType font “ESCHER” by <a href="/assets/escher.ttf">clicking here</a> (released under the <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net/about/">Do What the Fuck You Want to Public License</a>).</p>

<p>Two more long-standing projects to be completed; Controlling my telescope with my HP-41 calculator and (dis)proving Free Will through mathematical logic.</p>
