I"Æ<p><strong>Firstly</strong>: Merry X-Mas!</p>

<p><strong>Then</strong>: Welcome to the revamped isene.org.</p>

<p>I took the time to do a make-over of this site. Apart from the new looks, it
now works better on mobile devices with smaller screens.</p>

<p>The purpose is to make it simpler, less cluttered and with less clicking to
read the blog posts. I also added the opportunity to add comments to pages
such as my <a href="/scientology">Scientology page</a> or my <a href="/hp-41">HP-41 cave</a>.</p>

<p>Feel free to add you feedback via Disqus on this post. Just click the post
title to actually ‚Äúenter‚Äù the post and see the comment section at the bottom.</p>

<p>Also, had an old friend from the <a href="/2019/12/ItaloDisco.html">Midnight Magic radio show</a>, 
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristoffersandven/">Kristoffer Sandven</a> - a great guy and
a great photographer - take a new picture of me.</p>

<p><strong>And lastly</strong>: <strong><em>Have a fun 2020!</em></strong></p>
