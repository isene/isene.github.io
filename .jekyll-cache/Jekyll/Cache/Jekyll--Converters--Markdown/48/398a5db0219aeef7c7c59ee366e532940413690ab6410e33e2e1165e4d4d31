I"<p>One of the most thoughtful and empathetic people Iâ€™ve ever met, <a href="https://isene.me/2012/10/29/amazing-person-eliamani-sedoyeka-amani/">Amani
Sedoyeka</a>
is helping in any way he can. His family is highly respected because they are
highly effective in helping others without thought of reward.</p>

<p>Meet the amazing Amani and get inspired by his words, his actions.</p>

<p>Amani was the gateway to <a href="https://isene.me/2011/05/25/dont-touch-the-cows/">an adventure that Brendan and I will never
forget</a>.</p>
