I"<p>What kind of a pervert title is that?</p>

<p>No, really - “gopherhole” is a thing. And a cool thing at that.</p>

<p>Before the Web, there was
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)">Gopher</a>. And they lived
happily side-by-side for the better part of the 90s until the Web won out and
Gopher went into seclusion.</p>

<p>Gopher was - and is - a text-based web of information. It is simpler than the
Web, faster and free from bells, whistles and commercial distractions. It is a
“pure content” experience loved by some hard core geeks.</p>

<p>To put it in context: In 2007 there were less than 100 gopher servers in the
world. By 2012, there were 160. A slow growth since then has seen that number
grow to 361. I guess mine bumps that to 362.</p>

<p>The Web is driven by the “http” and “https” protocols while Gopher is driven
by the… “gopher” protocol.</p>

<p>Few browser supports the gopher protocol. You can use Firefox with the
<a href="http://gopher.floodgap.com/overbite/">Overbite</a> extension or a bunch of
different gopher clients (there’s a good one for Android,
“<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.afewroosloose.gopher&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US">DiggieDog</a>”).</p>

<p>Here is what my gopherhole looks like if you browse “gopher://isene.com” in
the pure text browser “<a href="https://lynx.invisible-island.net/">lynx</a>”:</p>

<p>I will publish only the distilled simplicity of my research and notes in
my gopherhole. Come join :-)</p>
