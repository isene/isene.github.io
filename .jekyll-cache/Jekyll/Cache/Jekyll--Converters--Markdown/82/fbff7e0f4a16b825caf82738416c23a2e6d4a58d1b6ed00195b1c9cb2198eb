I"q<p>I could boil everything I do down to one simple principle:</p>

<p><strong><em>Do that which helps - don’t do that which doesn’t help.</em></strong></p>

<p>The key to not having to clean up any mess is to not make a mess in the first place.</p>

<p>The key to not having to apologize for being stupid… is to not be stupid.</p>

<p>The solution to stress and being overworked is to stop taking on too many tasks.</p>

<p>Adding a negative emotion in a difficult situation is just dumb. It’s like picking up a large stone halfway through an Olympic swimming contest.</p>

<p>Not messing up is easier and more effective than making genius moves. You don’t always have to strive for perfection as long as you at least don’t sabotage yourself.</p>

<p>When I am successful it’s not primarily because I’m doing a lot of smart moves. It’s because I avoid doing stupid shit.</p>

<p>I’m not at all advocating avoiding new terretories. You should always try new things and master the art of failing. I’m simply advocating not sabotaging yourself.</p>

<p>And I’m not yet excellent in applying these principles, but I’m constantly working on them. I am a work in progress.</p>
