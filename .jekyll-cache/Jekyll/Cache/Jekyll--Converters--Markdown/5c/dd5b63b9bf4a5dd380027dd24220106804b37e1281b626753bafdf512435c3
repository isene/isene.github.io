I"<p>Here is an example of a motivational workshop we do in our company <a href="https://a-circle.no">“Å” (A-Circle)</a>.</p>

<p>It is our way of helping people get a motivation boost while in some degree of
Corona lock-down. We have done this workshop more than 20 times so far. and it
is version 8 of this simple slide that we base it on:</p>

<p>We make a habit of doing fun projects and workshops with fun people.</p>

<p>This time we did it without any audience, just so that you can check it out,
perhaps get a motivation boost and then give us some feedback so we can
improve further.</p>
