I"©<p>In Singapore working this week - on two discussion panels at the <a href="https://maritime.knect365.com/shipping2030-asia/">Shipping2030 conference</a>.</p>

<p>I love the diversity of this place, the buzzing, the many facets and places to view and enjoy.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m looking forward to challenging the conservative shipping industry to embrace more collaboration. Iâ€™d like to see the industry pull together with more <a href="https://isene.me/2011/08/13/ant-hill-innovation/">ant hill innovation</a>. Changing products, processes and policy is easy. Changing minds and culture is the challenge.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll be in New York next week. Drop me a line if youâ€™d like to meet for a coffee (g@isene.com)</p>
