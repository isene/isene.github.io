<p>At the tail end of <a href="https://isene.org/2019/02/RelevantMen.html">my interview</a> on  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/annmariebhola/">Annmarie Bhola</a>’s podcast, she asked me about my views on global warming. We had an interesting exchange that turned out as a podcast in its own right. We decided it would be a nice joint venture to present this interview on Geir’s Everything.</p>
