I"Ä<p>Itâ€™s been a great adventure with memories for life.</p>

<p>Of the 52 countries I have visited, the Japanese are the most polite, service minded and nicest people - with Tanzanians in a good second place. The Aussies are still the coolest. Tokyo is the nicest city Iâ€™ve been to. Sydney is still the most beautiful, New York the most spectacular, while Longyearbyen is my favorite.</p>

<p>When I visited Tokyo for the first time, 1.5 years ago, I had just finished my latte at a Starbucksâ€¦ when an employee kindly took the cup out of my hand and carried it the remaining 40 centimeters to the trash bin. I was befuddled and asked, â€œWhat just happened?â€ â€œBut, you are the customer, sir.â€ â€œYes, I knowâ€¦ but trust me, this would never have happened anywhere else on the planet.â€ I was amazed at the level of service. I still am. The hospitality is in a league of its own. I was not surprised that Japan joined the last 16 in the soccer world cup due to less yellow cards.</p>

<p>I have worked at <a href="https://www.nyk.com/ENGLISH/">NYK</a>â€™s headquarters for a month - at their â€œinnovation garageâ€, the subsidiary of <a href="https://www.monohakobi.com/en/">MTI</a>. It is as empathetic and welcoming as it can get. Great people - genuine and honest. A great team. Mr. Tanaka san is the manager of MTI - an empathetic and wise manager and the genius, Ando san is his right hand. Tanaka san is on my right in the picture above, Unfortunately, Ando san wasnâ€™t there today when we had the picture taken.</p>

<p>Niklas got the opportunity to travel with Ando and his family westward to his parentâ€™s home and stay there for a few days. Niklasâ€™ love of animals is also captured below :-)</p>

<p>There are a couple of other amazing people I should mention. My Kendo master, Kaz is at the bottom left. My main colleague has been Zaizen san (middle bottom). I had this challenge that he would break out of his Japanese self and send me a rude message before I left town. A couple of days ago he managed to overcome the emotional struggle and did just that. He was awarded with a crash course in Ruby programming. The most professional, quality minded and pedantic hair dresser I have ever met, Ishi is at the bottom right. There are many more amazing people I have met on this adventure, but I forget to take pictures :-/</p>

<p>I have written about the Japanese culture and their apprehension for failing and the resulting lack of innovation in <a href="https://isene.org/onepagebooks/#1pb-4-fail">the OnePageBook titled, #Fail</a>â€. MTI is NYKâ€™s step out of that limiting culture. And I believe that their innovation arm is what sets NYK apart from many other Japanese companies.</p>

<p>To sum it up, I love Tokyo and the Japanese people.</p>
