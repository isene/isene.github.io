<p>To become a good public speaker, practice.</p>

<p>To become a great public speaker, practice more.</p>

<p>Here are my tips for you along the way:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Decide on the impact and value you would like to make with the audience</li>
  <li>Instead of using slides, jot down a set of keywords or phrases that makes it likely for you to create that value</li>
  <li>Use your key words and concepts as Lego building blocks. Mold your presentation according to the responses from the audience</li>
  <li>Pay attention to the audience, <a href="https://isene.org/onepagebooks/#1pb-6-listening---superpower">listen</a>, be interactive, be there for them</li>
  <li>Be <a href="https://isene.org/2018/09/EasilyHurt.html">interested rather than interesting</a></li>
  <li>Be transparent, be yourself - say what you feel, what you see, what you experience</li>
</ol>

<p>Slides may help you in the beginning, and they may be useful later in presenting complex illustrations or data. But unless you are doing a set speach with no interaction with the audience, slides is more often a crutch, a burden. Like running with crutches, slides will limit your performance.</p>

<p>Practice more.</p>
