I"Ş<p>There are nuggets of gold to be found from most people who teach and coach others.</p>

<p>While most North American hyper &amp; overly extroverted coaches can come across as rather cheesy, there is wisdom to be had from the likes of Tony Robbins and Joe Polish. Even Jordan Peterson has a couple of worthwhile words of advice. This list from Joe Polish puts a clear perspective of the qualities of successful entrepreneurs:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Smart entrepreneurs are pursuers of betterment. They donâ€™t want to be the smartest person in the room; They want to be in a room where everybody is getting smarter</li>
  <li>They look for learning experiences they canâ€™t get anywhere else</li>
  <li>They invest big-time on themselves and experience psychological upgrades</li>
  <li>They also know life gives to the giver and takes from the taker</li>
  <li>They show up, act with integrity, give their best stuff and share</li>
  <li>They value discussions with other high-level entrepreneurs</li>
  <li>They are contributors and collaborators rather than competitors</li>
  <li>They also look for the right â€œwhoâ€™sâ€. They know that if they find the right â€œwhoâ€™sâ€, the right â€œwhoâ€™sâ€ bring the â€œwhatâ€ with them</li>
  <li>They purposefully put themselves in environments for who is NOT there, just as much for who is in there</li>
</ol>

<p>And to accomplish these, there is one quality that lies underneath all of them: The ability to be present, to be truly here and now.
