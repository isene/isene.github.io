I"£<p>Itâ€™s been 8 years since I did the series of blog posts on <a href="https://isene.me/?s=amazing+person">amazing
people</a> in my life. Itâ€™s time to add one
very special person: Siv Bayegan.</p>

<p>Apart from being incredible smart and wise, she has the most amazing drive to
improve in every situation she meets. Her passion to improve as a human being
is like none Iâ€™ve ever seen before. She strives to own every obstacle, every
challenge. Never pointing the finger or placing the blame, but taking full
responsibility for how she can improve going forward. Itâ€™s a passion I deeply
admire.</p>

<p>Siv has a deep care for others. She feels what others feel. She relates but at
the same time can expand on any situation by offering fresh new perspectives.
Thereâ€™s never a dull moment with Siv - the business woman, the engineer, the
spiritually aware, the listener, the friend, my love.</p>

<p>Siv has taken my life to a whole new level. I am blessed to have her by my
side. I am a better person since I met her one year ago. I am inspired and I
love to inspire her back.</p>

<p>Siv - I have a profound love for you.</p>
