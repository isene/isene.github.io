I"i<p>I’ve had the pleasure working more closely with a truly great guy the past few weeks - Øivind Haugland. He’s an excellent sounding board and he gets me thinking. Like what the exact value of what I do really is. And it boils down to this: Making Everything Simpler.</p>

<p>Like <a href="https://isene.org/hyperlist">HyperList</a> for structuring information in a simpler way. Or the <a href="https://isene.org/onepagebooks">OnePageBooks</a>. Or my explorations of <a href="https://isene.org/freewill">Free Will</a>. These are all efforts to simplify.</p>

<p>Whenever I do projects, coach people, write, make art or music, I try to simplify the process and the results.</p>
