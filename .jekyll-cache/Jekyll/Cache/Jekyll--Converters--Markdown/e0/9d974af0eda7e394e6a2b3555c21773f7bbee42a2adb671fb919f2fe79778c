I"š<p>My latest Covid relief: The T-REX</p>

<p>The Corona times has made room for doing more geek stuff. Iâ€™m lovinâ€™ it.</p>

<p>After creating the <a href="https://isene.org/2020/11/RTFM.html">RTFM</a> and
<a href="https://isene.org/2020/12/Astropanel.html">Astropanel</a>, time came to create
my own <a href="https://www.hpmuseum.org/rpn.htm">RPN</a> calculator for the terminal. I
have enjoyed creating this even though it took much less time than I was
hoping for (less than 20 hours). Hopefully someone will use it and start
nudging me for new features :-)</p>

<p>This screencast shows the program in use:</p>
