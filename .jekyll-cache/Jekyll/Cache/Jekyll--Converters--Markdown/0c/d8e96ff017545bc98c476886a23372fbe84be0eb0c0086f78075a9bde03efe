I"c<p>If you have followed my blogging on Somaliland, you will know that I am working to help that country create a software development industry.</p>

<p>Here’s the update to this project.</p>

<p>We launched <a href="http://kickassprogrammers.org">the website</a> to explain the project in the simplest of terms.</p>

<p>Take a look and tell me what you think.</p>

<p>While it is really easy to sell a commercial project for a millon dollars here in Norway, it is much harder to finance a project like this for Somaliland. And that is what we are busy working on - getting a few hundred thousand dollars to cover the cost of sending top notch programmers to tech their craft to eager students.</p>

<p>We have the students. We have the equipment. We have Internet access. We even have a few motivated teachers. But we lack the funds to pay them.</p>

<p>When the money is secured, we’ll kick off the project.</p>

<p>Stay tuned.</p>
