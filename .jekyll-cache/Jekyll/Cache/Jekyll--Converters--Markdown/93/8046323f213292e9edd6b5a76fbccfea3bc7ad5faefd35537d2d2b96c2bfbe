I"T<p>I am proud to present my latest project - the Astropanel.</p>

<p>This program will help you decide when you should bring out your telescope.</p>

<p>Feature list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Weather forecast for the next 9 days with coloring (red/yellow/green) based
on your limits for cloud cover, humidity, temperature and wind</li>
  <li>Easy graphic representation of when the Sun, Moon and planets are visible
with the Moon’s phase showing in how light the representing bar is</li>
  <li>Extra information for each day: Fog, wind gust speed, dew point temperature,
air pressure, UV Index, Sun and Moon precise rise and set and Moon phase.
The Moon phase is expressed as a number between 0 and 100 where 50 is the
full moon.</li>
  <li>Astronomical events for each of the 9 days, with option to list them in one
view</li>
  <li>Starchart showing in the terminal for the selected day and time of day</li>
  <li>A table showing RA, Dec, distance, rise, set and transit for the planets</li>
  <li>Show today’s Astronomy Picture Of the Day</li>
</ul>
