I"<p>Henning has got quite some traction here in Norway with his podcast
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/henningsverden/">Henning’s Verden</a>.</p>

<p>He interviews amazing people with unusual stories to tell, diving much
deeper with his subjects than ordinary interviews can do. Of all the
hundreds of media appearances I’ve done, Henning has been the most
relaxed and empathetic host I’ve met.</p>

<p>Here is our webinar with Henning Karwowski. We cover a lot of ground,
so this should be interesting for a wide audience:</p>
