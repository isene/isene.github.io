I"¡<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.brendanmartin.com/">Brendan</a> who discovered
<a href="https://calendly.com/">Calendly</a>, you can now book a 30 minute online
coaching session with me. Just follow the link in the bottom right corner and
book an available time slot that suits you.</p>

<p>We can talk over Google Hangout, Skype, Zoom, Signal, Messenger or any other
means that you like.</p>

<p>And itâ€™s free. I enjoy coaching a variety of different people. But this
doesnâ€™t have to be a coaching session. It could be a talk about science,
telescopes, music, artwork, photography, calculators, free will, Scientology,
mathematics, philosophy, RPGs, HyperList or anything else that life holds.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s talk.</p>
