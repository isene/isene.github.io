<p>Who should you surround yourself with?</p>

<p>Could there be a really simple answer to this seemingly complex subject?</p>

<p>My adventure to simplify everything has reached the subject of “evaluating
people”.</p>

<p>During my 10 years as a professional recruiter/headhunter, I focused on
determining a candidate’s personality, production record and how well the
candidate would fit the team. We reached a record breaking success in our
placements - but at a cost. Our evaluations were quite complex. And we did
only “safe placements”. I am quite sure we missed out on some “crazy geniuses”
that could have been far better than our safe choices. I wrote a couple of
books on the subject before I left that profession in 2000. After that I have
been doing recruitments for my own companies and still some for clients.</p>

<p>Over the years I have become more pragmatic and much simpler in my approach to
recruitment. And to everything else in life. I continually hunt for
simplicity and have now come down to what may well be the simplest way to
evaluate who you should sorround yourself with.</p>

<p>Listen in on this simple 4 minutes podcast. I could have made it in less than
a minute, but I was too lazy to simplify it further.</p>
