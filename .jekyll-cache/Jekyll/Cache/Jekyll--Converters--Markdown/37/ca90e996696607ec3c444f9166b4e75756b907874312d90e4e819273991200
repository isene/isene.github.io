I"j<p>I’m on a quest to reduce my principles in life to utter simplicity.</p>

<p>Here’s what I have boiled it down to so far - this covers pretty much <em>all</em> I do:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>MAKE EVERYTHING SIMPLE</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduce everything to only what is needed</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>DO ONLY THAT WHICH HELPS</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Focus on what you can control
        <ul>
          <li>Pick what excites you and do that</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Don’t spend energy on what you cannot control
        <ul>
          <li>Disregard the past &amp; much of the future - practice improvisation</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>BE INTERESTED</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Learn to do nothing - be present - listen</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>GIVE MORE PLUSSES</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Be empathetic - help others</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>ENJOY THE GAME</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Challenge yourself on the RALE scale - learn to enjoy as much as possible by moving on the scale
        <ul>
          <li><strong>R</strong> = Resist, <strong>A</strong> = Accept, <strong>L</strong> = Like, <strong>E</strong> = Enjoy</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I am working on reducing this furter. Any suggestions are of course very welcome.</p>
