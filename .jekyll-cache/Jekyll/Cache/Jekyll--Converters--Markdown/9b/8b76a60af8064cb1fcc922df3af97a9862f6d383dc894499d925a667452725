<p>Lots of random advice was offered. Hereâ€™s a collection of the coolest :)</p>

<ul>

  <li><strong><em>Nobody cares about your embarrassment. Whatever it is, forget it.</em></strong> (Roland)</li>
  <li><strong><em>Donâ€™t live in resentment and regretâ€¦ And forgive yourself. We all make mistakesâ€¦</em></strong> (Donna)</li>
  <li><strong><em>Respect yourself and set your standards:)</em></strong> (Konrad)</li>
  <li><strong><em>Have positive expectations, no matter what. Be open to surprises.</em></strong> (Flemming)</li>
  <li><strong><em>Take a different route home from work than you did to work. Change both the next dayâ€¦ also change mode of transportation frequently, even if it is just changing shoes.</em></strong> (Thomas)</li>
  <li><strong><em>Be like a dog: live in the moment and always assume the sale!</em></strong> (Mary)</li>

  <li><strong><em>No matter what, stay curious and stay playful.</em></strong> (Bruno)</li>
  <li><strong><em>Sing frecuently.</em></strong> (Susana)</li>

  <li><strong><em>Stop looking for advice.</em></strong> (Ãngel)</li>
  <li><strong><em>Donâ€™t listen to advice from others. Nobody knows what theyâ€™re talking about.</em></strong> (Pierce)</li>
  <li><strong><em>Take your own advice.</em></strong> (Simon)</li>
  <li><strong><em>If you want agreement - go find someone who agrees with you.</em></strong> (Lyn)</li>
