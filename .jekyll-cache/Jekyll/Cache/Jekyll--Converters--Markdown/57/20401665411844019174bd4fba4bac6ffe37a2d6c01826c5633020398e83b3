I"s<p>I’m on a quest to reduce my principles in life to utter simplicity.</p>

<p>Here’s what I have boiled it down to so far:</p>

<p>0  <strong>MAKE EVERYTHING SIMPLE</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://isene.org/onepagebooks/#1pb-12-make-it-simple">Reduce everything</a> to <a href="https://isene.org/2020/02/Simple.html">only what is needed</a>
00  <strong>“DO THAT WHICH HELPS. DON’T DO THAT WHICH DOESN’T HELP.”</strong>
    - Focus on what you can control
    <ul>
      <li>Pick what excites you and do that
    - Don’t spend energy on what you cannot control</li>
      <li>Disregard the past &amp; much of the future (practice improvisation)
1  <strong>BE <a href="https://isene.org/2018/09/Podcast-EasilyHurt.html">INTERESTED</a></strong>
    - Learn to <a href="https://isene.org/2018/11/Podcast-MentalTraining.html">do nothing</a> - be <a href="https://isene.org/onepagebooks/#1pb-2-mental-training---the-core">present</a> - <a href="https://isene.org/onepagebooks/#1pb-6-listening---superpower">listen</a>
2  <strong>GIVE MORE PLUSSES</strong>
    - Be empathetic - help others
3  <strong>ENJOY THE GAME</strong>
    - Challenge yourself on the <a href="https://isene.org/2020/03/RALE.html">RALE scale</a> - learn to enjoy as much as possible by moving on the scale</li>
      <li>R = Resist</li>
      <li>A = Accept</li>
      <li>L = Like</li>
      <li>E = Enjoy</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A big thanks goes to Brendan Martin for inspiration and being the best sounding board.</p>
