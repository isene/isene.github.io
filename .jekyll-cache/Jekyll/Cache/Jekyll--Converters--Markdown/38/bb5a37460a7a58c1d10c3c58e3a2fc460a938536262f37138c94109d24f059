I"î<p>My latest Covid relief: The T-REX</p>

<p>The Corona times has made room for doing more geek stuff.</p>

<p>After creating the RTFM and Astropanel, time came to create my own RPN
calculator for the terminal. I have enjoyed creating this even though it took
much less time than I was hoping for (less than 20 hours). Hopefully someone
will use it and start nudging me for new features :-)</p>

<p>This screencast shows the program in use:</p>
