I"í<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius">Marcus Aurelius</a> is one of my
favorite philosophers. His views capture much of how I conduct my life, but
with an extra dose of empathy.</p>

<p>In these Corona times, Marcus has som good advice captured in <strong><a href="https://iai.tv/articles/stoicism-amid-pandemic-panic-auid-1436">this must-read
article</a></strong>. Enjoy.</p>

<p>â€œNever let the future disturb you. You will meet it, if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present.â€</p>

<p>â€œYou have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.â€</p>

<p>â€œThe happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.â€</p>

<p>â€œWhen you arise in the morning think of what a privilege it is to be alive, to think, to enjoy, to love â€¦â€</p>

<p>â€œIt is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live.â€</p>

<p>â€œWaste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one.â€</p>
