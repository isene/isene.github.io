I"Š<p>A talk on simplicity - in coaching, in life, in games, in the search for truth and free will.</p>

<p>I pulled up the phone and my mini-mic and did this raw and personal talk in the woods. First take, no editing.</p>

<p>I cover some breaktroughs in coaching, my quest for free will and the best improvement practice Iâ€™ve found so far and its contrast to the complex mess called Scientology.</p>
