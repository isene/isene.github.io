I"r<p>This week Cathrine Skovli from our Facebook Group, “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/300454157896878">Help without thought of
reward</a>” hosted another Zoom
session. This time on the subject of setting goals.</p>

<p>It could serve as a continuation of my earlier blog post, “<a href="https://isene.org/2018/10/Podcast-Ambitions.html">Do you actually
need your goals and ambitions?</a>”.</p>

<p>We cover the setting of goals from different angles and for many different
situations.</p>

<p>Thanks to Cathrine for the initiativ, to Brendan for his wisdom and to Brian
and Harry for joining in on the Zoom call.</p>
