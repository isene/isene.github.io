I":<p>I am migrating my web presence over to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.</p>

<p>I love programming, and Ruby is often my language of choice. Being able to tweak my tools is both fun and essential for productivity. And since Jekyll is written in Ruby, I can have a great deal more control, fun and efficiency when I publish my stuff.</p>

<p>This is the very beginning of this migration. I will slowly move my static pages over here and then my blogging.</p>

<p>Right now, the domain <i>isene.org</i> points here. After the transition, I will have <a href="http://isene.com"><i>isene.com</i></a> also point somewhere to this site.</p>

<p>Cozying up here and starting to feel at home. How do you like my new living room?</p>
