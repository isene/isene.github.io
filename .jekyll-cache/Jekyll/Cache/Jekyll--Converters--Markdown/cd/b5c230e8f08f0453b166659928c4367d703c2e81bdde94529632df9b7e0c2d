I"Ò<p><strong><em>Tired of your kids lost in a game? Want them to read a book or play soccer
instead?</em></strong></p>

<p>Read on. Bear with me for a few paragraphs and you may get a slightly new
perspective.</p>

<p><img src="https://isene.org/assets/posts/esport1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I have kids. They are gamers.</p>

<p>As a mental trainer, there is one skill that my subjects benefits the most
from: Learning to be fully mentally present. Whether it is a random person off
the street or an executive, a stage artist or an olympic athlete - the skill of
truly being here and now is fundamental to everything else we do. It is the
basic ability on which training, productivity, performance and focus is built.</p>

<p>This is well covered in the OnePageBook, ‚Äú<a href="https://isene.org/onepagebooks/#1pb-2-mental-training---the-core">Mental training - The
core‚Äù</a>.</p>

<p>While most people can get through a work day being less than 10% mentally
there, some professions require a much higher degree of mental presence.</p>

<p>The biathlete <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiril_Eckhoff">Tiril Eckhoff</a>
must have an immense presence and focus to be able to shoot down her targets.</p>

<p>The ballerina <a href="https://operaen.no/en/persons/the-norwegian-national-ballet/maiko-nishino/">Maiko
Nishimo</a>
must have a pure and clean presence as she delivers a world class performance.</p>

<p>These are just two examples of people I help to maintain a stable mental
presence. They both have to train hard to master the skill of being here and
now.</p>

<p>Some kids train this skill without even knowing it. Some kids do this training
every day. The gamers. They get to keep the natural ability that we are all
born with.</p>

<p>Many gamers are exercizing this ability to be here and now more than 5 hours
every day. The professional e-sport contenders put in more hours than any
other professional sports.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre not there <strong>fully focused and in the game</strong> you‚Äôre getting taken
out. You get fragged, you run the car off the road, you miss that one
opportunity, you lose. No other endeavor I know requires such an intense
mental presence and focus over such long stretches of time.</p>

<p>It boggles the mind how some are able to extend the boundaries of what we
thought was humanly possible. They train on being <em>in the zone</em>.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://rankedkings.com/blog/how-many-people-play-league-of-legends">more than 100
million</a>
active League of Legends players, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/746230/fortnite-players/">250
million</a>
Fortnite players and hundreds of millions playing other games, there is an
enormous amount of kids who exercise focus and mental presence every day.</p>

<p><img src="https://isene.org/assets/posts/esport5.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Read a book instead? Comfy in a sofa, half there - half somewhere else‚Ä¶
Or on a the pitch playing ball? Mentally in and out of the game‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Yes, balance matters. Yes, physical exersize is important. Social
interactions, picking up girls and learning math are all valuable skills.</p>

<p>But the kids are not merely ‚Äú<em>wasting their time paying games</em>‚Äù. They get to
exercize some abilities better than any other activity can give them. It can
even help them focus in school.</p>

<p>So parents; embrace your kid‚Äôs gaming. Or better, get in on the action and see
how your focus and mental presence compares.</p>
