I"¯<p>Itâ€™s been a few years since I created music. I decided to get into the creative mode again and here it is - â€œ<i>To the Castle</i>â€. Inspired by fantasy movies and the <a href="http://d6gaming.org">Amar Role-Playing Game</a>. Every other week I am hosting a Role-Playing session for eight inspirational youngsters. Itâ€™s great fun and it opens up some interesting creative paths. Like the urge to create some music. Enjoy :)</p>
