<p>I am often approached by pupils and students doing an essay or presentation on Scientology in class. I point them to <a href="https://isene.org/scientology">my page here on Scientology</a> with links to posts, articles, videos and even books I have written on the subject. But something was missing: A simple and short introduction to what it actually is.</p>

<p>Leaving the glorified PR to the Church and the venomous take-downs to the critics, here is a podcast that answers the question, “What is Scientology?”</p>

<p>I cover the basic Scientology beliefs, Clear, OT, the question of whether Scientology is a religion or a cult, Hubbard and more.</p>
