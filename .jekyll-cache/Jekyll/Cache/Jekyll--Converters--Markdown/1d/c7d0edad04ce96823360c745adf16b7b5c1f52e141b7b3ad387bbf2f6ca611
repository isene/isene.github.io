<p>In this podcast, I introduce a really simple role-playing game: The Amar Lite. The rule system can be read and understood in 15 minutes and is playable with kids down to 5 years old. Along with the game system itself, I have created a set of ready-made characters and a one page adventure that makes it easy to get playing right away. Take your kids, friends or grand parents into a fantasy world rescuing the wife of a distressed dwarven merchant. Playable in one short evening with lots of fun. On <a href="http://d6gaming.org">d6gaming.org</a> you find the <a href="http://d6gaming.org/index.php/Amar_Lite">Amar Lite rules</a> and the <a href="http://d6gaming.org/index.php/The_first_Amar_Lite_adventure">first Amar Lite adventure</a>. Give it a try and let me know what you think.</p>
