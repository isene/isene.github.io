I"Z<p>There is a common misconception among laymen and scientists alike that if you
throw a dice an infinite amount of times, you will get at least one 6. Perhaps
even an infinite amount of 6s.</p>

<p>Or, with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse">multiverse theory</a> -
if you have an infinite amount of universes, you will have another universe
exactly like our own. And one where the only difference is that you choose a
vanilla ice cream instead of the chocolate. Or even an infinite number of
universes where you choose the strawberry option.</p>

<p>This is a bold, even unfounded claim. Because if you throw a dice an infinite
number of times, the chance of NOT getting a 6 approaches 1/∞. And an infinite
number of 1/∞ would constitute ∞/∞. More specifically, the claim is:</p>

<p>Or in plain English: If you multiply some infinitesimally small amount an
infinity amount of times, the number (integer) that it occurs must be greater
than zero. This is unfounded, as infinity divided by infinity remains
undecided.</p>
