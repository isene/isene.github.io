I"R<p>This week I created a Facebook Group, “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/300454157896878">Help without thought of
reward</a>”.</p>

<p>It was in a way a reaction to all the social groups where people hang around
to get clients, solicit business, sell products or offer help to gain something back.</p>

<p>My Facebook group is purely altruistic. It’s a place where people give help
freely and without thought of reward. Help because it helps others.</p>

<p>I try to keep politics and religion out of the group and encourage people to
think if their post or comment actually help others in some way.</p>

<p>We get anything from general tips and advice to food recipes, tech tips, life
coaching tools and any other helpful posts.</p>

<p>It grew to more than 500 members in less than four days and I’m enjoying
people’s willingness to share and help each other.</p>

<p>One of the members, Cathrine Skovli wanted to do a Zoom session on
“procrastination”. She invited a panel to participate, recorded the session
and posted it on the group. The panel consisted of Signe-Marie Hernes Bjerke,
Brendan Martin and myself with Vinay Agarwala listening in and commenting.</p>

<p>Cathrine wants to make this into a weekly show, and so we have something
tangible from this group right off the bat. And here’s the first episode:</p>
