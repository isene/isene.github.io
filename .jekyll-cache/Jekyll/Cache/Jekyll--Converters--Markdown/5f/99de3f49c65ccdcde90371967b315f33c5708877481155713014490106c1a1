<p>Earlier today I held a workshop in Troms√∏ - north of the arctic circle - at the annual <a href="http://wistainternational2018.com/">WISTA conference</a> (WISTA being the ‚Äú<a href="https://www.wista.net/">Women‚Äôs International Shipping &amp; Trading Association</a>‚Äù). The topic of my workshop was ‚Äú<i>Digitization, robots and AI. Why women will be the last to be replaced by robots and AI</i>‚Äù. I was having a fun three hours with 25 smart and inspiring women. And to sum it up, I decided to wrap it all into a podcast.</p>

<p>I referenced the article, ‚Äú<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ku3dl8rcoxfra2j/process.pdf?raw=1">Processes, automation and human potential</a>‚Äù in the workshop. I also mentioned a few OnePageBooks relevant to the subject, <a href="https://isene.org/onepagebooks/#1pb-4-fail">#Fail</a>, <a href="https://isene.org/onepagebooks/#1pb-5-how-to-help-a-friend-in-trouble">How to help a friend in trouble</a>, <a href="https://isene.org/onepagebooks/#1pb-2-mental-training---the-core">Mental trainen - The core</a> and of course <a href="https://isene.org/onepagebooks/#1pb-12-make-it-simple">Simple!</a>.</p>

<p>I also showed two videos during the workshop. One dealing with empathy:</p>

<p>‚Ä¶and one dealing with how to exercise your empathy - which is in essence one of the exercises covered in the OnePageBook on mental training:</p>
