<p>This is my first podcast here at isene.org. I talk about the range of topics I may cover in my upcoming podcasts - anything from sex to astrophysics. Want me to cover something special? Want to challenge me? State your wish in the comment section below. It may come true :-)</p>

<p>PS: As I mention in the podcast, I tried experimenting with Octopod as the podcast platform. But it was way more complex than simply embedding an anchor.fm podcast in an iframe like above.</p>
