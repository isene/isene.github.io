My latest Covid relief: The T-REX

The Corona times has made room for doing more geek stuff. I'm lovin' it.

After creating the [RTFM](https://isene.org/2020/11/RTFM.html) and
[Astropanel](https://isene.org/2020/12/Astropanel.html), time came to create
my own [RPN](https://www.hpmuseum.org/rpn.htm) calculator for the terminal. I
have enjoyed creating this even though it took much less time than I was
hoping for (less than 20 hours). Hopefully someone will use it and start
nudging me for new features :-)

This screencast shows the program in use:
