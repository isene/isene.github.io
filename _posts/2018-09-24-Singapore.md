In Singapore working this week - on two discussion panels at the [Shipping2030 conference](https://maritime.knect365.com/shipping2030-asia/).

I love the diversity of this place, the buzzing, the many facets and places to view and enjoy.

I'm looking forward to challenging the conservative shipping industry to embrace more collaboration. I'd like to see the industry pull together with more [ant hill innovation](https://isene.me/2011/08/13/ant-hill-innovation/). Changing products, processes and policy is easy. Changing minds and culture is the challenge.

I'll be in New York next week. Drop me a line if you'd like to meet for a coffee (g@isene.com)
