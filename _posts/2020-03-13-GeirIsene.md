Inspired by my collegue Brendan Martin who made a methodology based on his name, I decided to do the same.

To brainstorm and envision a goal, you need four ingredients. The goal must be:

```
 G = Groundbreaking
 E = Exciting
 I = Impressive
 R = Radiating
```

Not only should it be groundbreaking, exciting and impressive - it must
radiate to inspire change in people's lives.

In order to realize the goal, you need five components:

```
 I = 1
 S = Simple
 E = Effective
 N = Needed
 E = Energising
```

You need one (1) simple, effective, needed and energising step to take you
toward that goal. When you do that step, you again need one simple, effective,
needed and energising step.
