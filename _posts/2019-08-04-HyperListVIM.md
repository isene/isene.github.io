If you don't know what HyperList is, read [this OnePageBook](https://isene.org/onepagebooks/#1pb-7-describe-anything---simple-and-effective).

My very first screencast introduces the HyperList plugin for the VIM text editor. It is one of the most feature packed plugins of the thousands of VIM plugins out there. In the screencast, I cover some cool features that may inspire you to start using this plugin for your favorite text editor.
