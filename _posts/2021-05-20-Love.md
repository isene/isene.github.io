It was a deeper connection than they had ever felt. 

Disregarding their past and any emotional baggage. Because here and now mattered. 

Love, loyalty, unity and being there for each other. Total support without any shame, blame or regret. 

Bumps were part of the ride, because waves, wind, rocks and fire are all part of life's adventures. 

But issues were addressed swiftly without shifting responsibility. Because both took full responsibility for self, the other and for their unity. 

Sometimes beaten, but never beaten up. Nothing was swept under the carpet, but nothing was ever forced. The connection was as strong as it was natural for both. The strength was built on trust. 

Warmth, cuddle, sex and the very long hugs. 

Sometimes one would fall and the other would catch. Even when both fell, they always had the intention and mustered an inner strength to stand up for the other. 

While they didn't always fully understand each other, they always tried. As with most relationships, the start was more bumpy and misunderstandings more frequent. But with care, good intentions and heart, they strived to understand better and make the connection stronger. 

And simpler makes stronger. 


*Anything less is a miss.*
