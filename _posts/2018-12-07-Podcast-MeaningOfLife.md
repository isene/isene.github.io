<i>Is there any meaning, any purpose to life? What is the true path? Religion? Science? The arts, sports, parenting, helping others, yourself, collecting stuff, happiness, action, inaction or something entirely different? What on Earth - or elsewhere - could be the meaning of all this?</i>

In this podcast I cover what the meaning of life could be. I also cover your one, main asset as a human being - your ability to inspire meaning in life... for yourself and for others.

As with any ability or skill, it needs exercising. And in this podcast I propose a project for you: Do at least one action every day for a month that inspires real meaning in your life or someone else's life.

I will keep a running record here of the most meaningful acts I do every day until 2019-01-07:
