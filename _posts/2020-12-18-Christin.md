Listen in for a Fantastic motivational Zoom webinar with the amazing Christin Oldebr√•ten.

Christin quit her leader position to take a year off in nature. And she
continues on the path of living slowly and in harmony with nature.

She helps and [inspires outdoor enjoyment](https://friluftsglede.no/) for so many.

She arranges tire training and mountain hikes.

In addition, her family has a [clinic in Uganda](https://friluftsglede.no/mitandi/). 

Christin is an empathetic, down-to-earth person with a big heart.
