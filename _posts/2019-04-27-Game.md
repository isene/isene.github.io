Let's review the game we all call life. Brendan's brainchild, the simplicity is striking as usual.

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/onepagebooks/13-game/1PB_Game.pdf"><img src="/assets/onepagebooks/13-game/cover.jpg" width="360" alt="Simple" /></a></p>

This time I did a video blog post on the book release. It includes some philosophy and quantum mechanics just to spice it up.

As usual, you will find it in the [OnePageBooks section](/onepagebooks#1pb-13-game-review-life").
