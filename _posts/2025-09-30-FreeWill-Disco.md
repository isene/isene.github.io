This is a teaser for my upcoming book, "Freedom Proof" that in turn is based on my TEG framework - the mathematical framwork leading to the necessity of free will.

This deep disco version is an alternative take on the track "Free Will" featured on my recent album **"The Lighthouse"**, available on Spotify and other music platforms.

Music and video crafted through AI experimentation, blending genre exploration with visual storytelling.
