I'm on a quest to reduce my principles in life to utter simplicity.

Here's what I have boiled it down to so far - this covers pretty much *all* I do:

1. **MAKE EVERYTHING SIMPLE**
   - Reduce everything to only what is needed
2. **DO ONLY THAT WHICH HELPS**
	- Focus on what you can control
		- Pick what excites you and do that
	- Don't spend energy on what you cannot control
		- Disregard the past & much of the future - practice improvisation
3. **BE INTERESTED**
	- Learn to do nothing - be present - listen
4. **GIVE MORE PLUSSES**
	- Be empathetic - help others
5. **ENJOY THE GAME**
	- Challenge yourself on the RALE scale - learn to enjoy as much as possible by moving on the scale
		- **R** = Resist, **A** = Accept, **L** = Like, **E** = Enjoy

I am working on reducing this furter. Any suggestions are of course very welcome.

A big thanks goes to [Brendan Martin](http://www.brendanmartin.com/) for inspiration and being the best sounding board.
