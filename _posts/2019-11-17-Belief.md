While I certainly hold true that anyone has the right to believe anything,
an important negative side of religion or any belief has become clearer to me.

A belief can become a barrier to discover truth. A belief is a substitute
for facts. It is often difficult for a person to want to search out facts in
an area where a belief is held.

Religion contains a composition of beliefs. If held strongly enough, the
person can become fact-blind or incapable of accepting proven truths contrary
to his or her beliefs.

I am not restricting facts here to the physical universe. Facts can also be
derived by pure logic, mathematics, philosophy or even personal metaphysical
experience. But beware of your beliefs, they may be your worst enemies.

Beliefs or preconceived ideas can fog your ability to choose the right job,
client, girlfriend or new employee. It can stop you from reaching your
potential.
