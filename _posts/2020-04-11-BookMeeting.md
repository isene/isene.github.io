Thanks to [Brendan](https://www.brendanmartin.com/) who discovered
[Calendly](https://calendly.com/), you can now book a 30 minute online
coaching session with me. Just follow the link in the bottom right corner and
book an available time slot that suits you.

We can talk over Google Hangout, Skype, Zoom, Signal, Messenger or any other
means that you like.

And it's free. I enjoy coaching a variety of different people. But this
doesn't have to be a coaching session. It could be a talk about science,
telescopes, music, artwork, photography, calculators, free will, Scientology,
mathematics, philosophy, RPGs, HyperList or anything else that life holds.

Let's talk.
