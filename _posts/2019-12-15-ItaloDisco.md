[Midnight Magic](https://books.google.no/books?id=M91HDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT61&lpg=PT61&dq=%22Midnight+Magic%22+radio&source=bl&ots=qDkoA7soxl&sig=ACfU3U0HnptxlzSHv__PDiAtXiXvT0KBvA&hl=no&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiAotuElLjmAhV066YKHeYuB-84ChDoATAGegQICRAB#v=onepage&q=%22Midnight%20Magic%22%20radio&f=false) was a local radio station show running from 1987 until 1990 on Radio City/Oslo and Radio Oslofjord. It is the only radio show in Norway that had a boot leg black market with cassette tapes selling for as much as USD 50 at the time. It brought [role-playing](http://d6gaming.org/index.php/Main_Page) to the air and we got to the second spot in the ratings, only beaten by Coca Cola Top 30.

As the father of Midnight Magic and the show's proponent of Italo Disco music, I've put together a playlist that the audience at the time would feel very familiar with. A special thanks goes to Stein Halvorsen, my co-host on the program.

The playlist goes from early, slower Italo Disco to later, more Hi Energy. Enjoy :-)
