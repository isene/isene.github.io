A lot is happening over at the [Amar wiki](https://d6.gaming.org). With plenty
of new ideas from players and with solid play testing, some fundamental
concepts have come to the fore.

Having developed role-playing game systems for more than 35 years, I thought I
had covered most bases. But then came my 16 year old son Jonatan and beat me
hands down. He has devised a rather neat new way of thinking about magic in
a fantasy role-playing game. Take a look at [Incantation
Magic](http://d6gaming.org/index.php/Incantation_Magic) and let us know what
you think.

Then there is the ever evolving combat systems. One of the most challenging
tasks I face as a Games Master is to realistically handle larger combats. With
all motion during a battle, it is important to capture the dynamics of all
the commotion. Who moves where and who gets to hit who and at what penalties,
etc. As it is impossible to fully capture all details, a game system must
resort to sensible abstractions that balance drama, realism and game flow.

With the [new experimental combat
system](http://d6gaming.org/index.php/Experimental_Systems#New_combat_system),
I believe we are a step closer to a good game balance. Again, take a look and
give your thoughts - either as a comment to this blog post or directly via mail
(g@isene.com).
