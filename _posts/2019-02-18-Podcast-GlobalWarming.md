At the tail end of [my interview](https://isene.org/2019/02/RelevantMen.html) on  [Annmarie Bhola](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annmariebhola/)'s podcast, she asked me about my views on global warming. We had an interesting exchange that turned out as a podcast in its own right. We decided it would be a nice joint venture to present this interview on Geir's Everything.

So here you go - my views on man-made climate change in a podcast.
