I had to get Jonatan to grow up and help me to complete this project from 1999.

Ever since I was a kid, I was fascinated by the [works of](https://mcescher.com/) the Dutch artist [M.C. Escher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._C._Escher). His artwork is very diverse, but it was his drawings of "[impossible objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_object)" that caught my interest and has remained an inspiration all my life. His "Waterfall" started my fascination with dimensions and led me to explore dimesions above 3 - with me and a high school friend experimenting with [Convay's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in both 4, 5 and 6 dimensions.

Twenty years ago I decided to make a font based on his ideas - my own tribute to the artist. With pen and pencil I jotted down a few characters based on his impossible drawings during a family vacation in Portugal. But then I got stuck and left the project. I did revisit the task several times but never got it completed before now. Jonatan has been designing and redesigning characters with me since a few days, and here it is, the font:

The whole character set consists of the capital letters A-Z and the numbers 0-9. We are planning to add a few more symbols like punctuation mark, hyphen, comma and a few others.

As you can see, the M, and W are variations of [Impossible Trident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_trident) while the 6 and 9 contains the [Penrose Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_triangle).

You can download and freely use the TrueType font "ESCHER" by [clicking here](/assets/escher.ttf) (released under the [Do What the Fuck You Want to Public License](http://www.wtfpl.net/about/)).

There are now only two more long-standing projects that I feel I should complete; Controlling my telescope with my HP-41 calculator and (dis)proving Free Will through mathematical logic.
