**Increase your productivity. Create better ToDo lists. Describe projects and processes more consisely. Reduce any concept down to pure simplicity. Use HyperList.**

You can put any description of anything down as a simple HyperList. On paper, on a board, in a document. HyperList itself is just a way to describe stuff - some rules and ways to make descriptions simpler. And now this method is released in a new version - 2.4.

It has been more than 4 years since HyperList last saw an upgrade. The methodology is extraordinarily complete, and the latest added feature is perhaps minor: Check section 4.3.2.1 of the [HyperList definition document](https://www.dropbox.com/s/u88hiepntca589w/hyperlist.pdf?raw=1) for the new relative reference feature.

I have mixed feelings, seeing it has become this complete and stable... there is less opportunity to tinker and perfect it. Which is why I would like to encourage any and all suggestions for improvements. 

Here's [a primer on HyperList](https://isene.org/onepagebooks/#1pb-7-describe-anything---simple-and-effective).

And here is the [home page for HyperList](https://isene.org/hyperlist/).

If you are using [VIM](http://www.vim.org) as your text editor, you can use the [HyperList plugin](https://github.com/isene/hyperlist.vim) to effectively handle your lists. It is one of the most feature packed VIM plugins ever created. In its latest release, I added a full tutorial that walks you through all the features of this plugin. It's been 56 releases of this software since its inception more than 10 years ago (then named WOIM). A thanks goes to many who have contributed to the development (check the docs for credits).
