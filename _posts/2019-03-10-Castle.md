It's been a few years since I created music. I decided to get into the creative mode again and here it is - "<i>To the Castle</i>". Inspired by fantasy movies and the [Amar Role-Playing Game](http://d6gaming.org). Every other week I am hosting a Role-Playing session for eight inspirational youngsters. It's great fun and it opens up some interesting creative paths. Like the urge to create some music. Enjoy :)
