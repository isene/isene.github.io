<i>"The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time."</i> (Mark Twain)

<i>"It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live."</i> (Marcus Aurelius)

It's a hard hitting provocative OnePageBook. We nkow it will not go down as popular with some people. But that may just be all the more reason to publish this and let people chew on its one, simple point.

As usual, you will find it in the [OnePageBooks section](/onepagebooks#1pb-14-youre-gonna-die) - including the option to buy them as e-books on Amazon..
