I was looking for an intellectual challenge I could feel passionate about.
Some itch I just had to scratch. And keep on scratching. Something geeky.

And as usual, it just pops out from nowhere. I ask, it comes. Can't explain
exactly how. This time it happened to be the creation of a file manager from
scratch.

I love the terminal as a workspace. I do most of my work - writing, e-mail,
reading, editing, programming in the terminal. A consistent interface where I
have full control.

Having used a bunch of different terminal file managers like
[Vifm](https://vifm.info/) and [Ranger](https://ranger.github.io/) I wasn't
fully satisfied. My perfectionism craved a consistency that I couldn't quite
quench. I had just gotten around to create a comprehensive color scheme for my
terminal with specific coloring of more than 500 different file types. I
wanted the same color setup for my file manager.

I tried to figure out how I could do that in Ranger, but that proved
difficult, so I ended up with creating a theme for that file manager that
showed a mere subset of my large color scheme. Not good enough.

I ended up writing the Ruby Terminal File Manager from scratch. It's obviously
written in my favorite production programming language, Ruby.

I was surprised that I could add all the features necessary to replace Ranger
in less than 40 hours and with only 700 lines of code. I knew nothing about
programming in "curses" when I started (a library for creating and managing
"windows" within a terminal). I had to learn a bunch of other stuff as well.
But when I get going, I don't waste time.

I have added a few more features since I booted Ranger and I'm hoping to add
more as long as I can keep creating this passion.

A major benefit from doing this is that I can have any feature I need or want
without having to ask others to program something for me. I can simply open
up [VIM](https://www.vim.org/) and program the feature of the day.

As usual, you can get the [RTFM code on
Github](https://github.com/isene/RTFM), install it and run it if you like.

Just for kicks, I also created a screencast as an introduction to RTFM:
