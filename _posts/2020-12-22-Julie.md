Welcome to our last webinar in 2020 :-)

We have a great motivational talk with the amazing actress and former alcohol addict [Julie Winge](https://www.juliewinge.no/).

She now helps hundreds of people find their way out of addiction.

In these special times and with Christmas is coming, what a great way to finish the last webinar of 2020.

If you don't hear from me for the rest of the year, have a **great Christmas** and an **inspiring New Year**!
