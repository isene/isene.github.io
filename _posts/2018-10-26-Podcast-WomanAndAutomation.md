Earlier today I held a workshop in Troms√∏ - north of the arctic circle - at the annual [WISTA conference](http://wistainternational2018.com/) (WISTA being the "[Women's International Shipping & Trading Association](https://www.wista.net/)"). The topic of my workshop was "<i>Digitization, robots and AI. Why women will be the last to be replaced by robots and AI</i>". I was having a fun three hours with 25 smart and inspiring women. And to sum it up, I decided to wrap it all into a podcast.

I referenced the article, "[Processes, automation and human potential](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ku3dl8rcoxfra2j/process.pdf?raw=1)" in the workshop. I also mentioned a few OnePageBooks relevant to the subject, [#Fail](https://isene.org/onepagebooks/#1pb-4-fail), [How to help a friend in trouble](https://isene.org/onepagebooks/#1pb-5-how-to-help-a-friend-in-trouble), [Mental trainen - The core](https://isene.org/onepagebooks/#1pb-2-mental-training---the-core) and of course [Simple!](https://isene.org/onepagebooks/#1pb-12-make-it-simple).

I also showed two videos during the workshop. One dealing with empathy:

...and one dealing with how to exercise your empathy - which is in essence one of the exercises covered in the OnePageBook on mental training:
