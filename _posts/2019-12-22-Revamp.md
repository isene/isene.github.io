**Firstly**: Merry X-Mas!

**Then**: Welcome to the revamped isene.org.

I took the time to do a make-over of this site. Apart from the new looks, it
now works better on mobile devices with smaller screens.

The purpose is to make it simpler, less cluttered and with less clicking to
read the blog posts. I also added the opportunity to add comments to pages
such as my [Scientology page](/scientology) or my [HP-41 cave](/hp-41).

Feel free to add you feedback via Disqus on this post. Just click the post
title to actually "enter" the post and see the comment section at the bottom.

Also, had an old friend from the [Midnight Magic radio show](/2019/12/ItaloDisco.html), 
[Kristoffer Sandven](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristoffersandven/) - a great guy and
a great photographer - take a new picture of me.

**And lastly**: ***Have a fun 2020!***
