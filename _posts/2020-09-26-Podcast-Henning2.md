Back on the brilliant podcast, "Henning's Verden".

This time we talk about a wide range of subjects - centered around the pursuit
of happiness. 

Topics ranges from what makes people happy, how to handle unhappiness, the
problem with Heaven and Nirvana, what happens when you reach your goals,
safety in life, pushing boundaries, giving without thought of reward,
happiness in mathematics, the pursuit of a Theory of Everything in physics,
alternative energy sources and more.

Yes, it's in Norwegian. A language course may be helpful.
