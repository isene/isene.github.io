I am migrating my web presence over to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

I love programming, and Ruby is often my language of choice. Being able to tweak my tools is both fun and essential for productivity. And since Jekyll is written in Ruby, I can have a great deal more control, fun and efficiency when I publish my stuff.

This is the very beginning of this migration. I will slowly move my static pages over here and then my blogging.

Right now, the domain <i>isene.org</i> points here. After the transition, I will have [<i>isene.com</i>](http://isene.com) also point somewhere to this site.

Cozying up here and starting to feel at home. How do you like my new living room?
