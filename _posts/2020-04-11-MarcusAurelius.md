[Marcus Aurelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius) is one of my
favorite philosophers. His views capture much of how I conduct my life, but
with an extra dose of empathy.

In these Corona times, Marcus has som good advice captured in **[this must-read
article](https://iai.tv/articles/stoicism-amid-pandemic-panic-auid-1436)**. Enjoy.

“Never let the future disturb you. You will meet it, if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present.” 

“You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.” 

“The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.” 

“When you arise in the morning think of what a privilege it is to be alive, to think, to enjoy, to love ...” 

“It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live.” 

“Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one.”
