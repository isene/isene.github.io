In this podcast, I introduce a really simple role-playing game: The Amar Lite. The rule system can be read and understood in 15 minutes and is playable with kids down to 5 years old. Along with the game system itself, I have created a set of ready-made characters and a one page adventure that makes it easy to get playing right away. Take your kids, friends or grand parents into a fantasy world rescuing the wife of a distressed dwarven merchant. Playable in one short evening with lots of fun. On [d6gaming.org](http://d6gaming.org) you find the [Amar Lite rules](http://d6gaming.org/index.php/Amar_Lite) and the [first Amar Lite adventure](http://d6gaming.org/index.php/The_first_Amar_Lite_adventure). Give it a try and let me know what you think.
