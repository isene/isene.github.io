Welcome to our first webinar of 2021 :-)

The Olympic Gold medalist Øystein "Pølsa" Pettersen shares his uncommon common
sense as a former top international ski sensation now turned coach and
motivator.

Listen to his straight-forward and to-the-point wisdom.

This webinar is in Norwegian - but we agreed to do one in English at a later
stage.
