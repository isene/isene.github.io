I am often approached by pupils and students doing an essay or presentation on Scientology in class. I point them to [my page here on Scientology](https://isene.org/scientology) with links to posts, articles, videos and even books I have written on the subject. But something was missing: A simple and short introduction to what it actually is.  

Leaving the glorified PR to the Church and the venomous take-downs to the critics, here is a podcast that answers the question, "What is Scientology?"

I cover the basic Scientology beliefs, Clear, OT, the question of whether Scientology is a religion or a cult, Hubbard and more.
