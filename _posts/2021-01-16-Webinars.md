Here's two more interesting webinars for you. [Cathrine
Skovli](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE6jiubHIWtim4UshEUa2dw/featured) is
on a roll, setting up one cool webinar after the other.

First we have a webinar with Aksel Inge Sinding - a psychologist specializing
in emotions. Here's how Cathrine framed this webinar:

<i>Starting in Norwegian, but we shift to english after a few minutes :-)
Aksel Inge Sinding is helping people and kids deal with and understanding
their emotions. He is active in webinars, podcasts and he has, for a number of
years run public information about emotions and mental health. Among other
things, through articles, courses, lectures, media assignments and a regular
column in Aftenposten (Norwegian national newspaper). Aksel has also written
the book "Wise on emotions".</i>

Then we have a very different webinar - with one of the World's most extreme
athletes, Frode Lein. Again, here's Cathrine's take:

<i>Frode is one of Norway's roughest ultra runners. He has a top position in
some of the world's most extreme stage races, both those that are ranked as
the world's warmest and coldest, as well as high up in extreme mountain
ranges. Frode has challenged the toughest athletes over high mountains,
through dangerous deserts, jungles, savannas and at the South Pole.</i>
