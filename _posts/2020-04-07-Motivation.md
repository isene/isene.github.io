Here is an example of a motivational workshop we do in our company ["Å" (A-Circle)](https://a-circle.no).

It is our way of helping people get a motivation boost while in some degree of
Corona lock-down. We have done this workshop more than 20 times so far. and it
is version 8 of this simple slide that we base it on:

We make a habit of doing fun projects and workshops with fun people.

This time we did it without any audience, just so that you can check it out,
perhaps get a motivation boost and then give us some feedback so we can
improve further.
