<i>"I wanted to turn my divorce into a positive.  What if I didn’t blame the other person for anything, and held myself 100 percent accountable? What if I checked my own shit at the door and put my children first? And reminded myself about the things about my ex-husband that I love, and fostered the friendship?” </i> (Gwyneth Paltrow)

Be calm and divorce with minimum fuckups. Learn to set priorities and navigate a breakup in a rational way.
