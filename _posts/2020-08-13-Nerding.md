title: In search of the perfect pocket device

In my lock-down geekery, I have been searching for the perfect pocket computer setup.
 
Having been an [HP calculator collector](https://youtu.be/czzuz1j364E) since a couple of decades, I have a passion for pocket computing power with really long battery life.

The [HP-41](https://isene.org/hp-41/) is an amazing calculator with months of battery life. But it is still a calculator. I also want real computing power - with the ability to run [VIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)) for editing text (with a decent keyboard) and as much of other goodies as I can cram into it.

I started my quest for the perfect pocket computer with reviving my old [HP-200LX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_200LX). It's a very early pocket computer running DOS 5.0 - and I have VIM running on it :-) Being a DOS device, it can run [lots of nice programs](http://mizj.com/). Yes, it is slow, but it is cool.

In search for a better keyboard, I got the [Ericsson MC218](http://phonedb.net/index.php?m=device&id=840&c=ericsson_mc218) (a [Psion Series 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_Series_5) pocket computer) up and running, hoping to make it boot Linux. While this is possible, it turns out that the CF card reader on the device was flaky, so I kept searching.

Some forums later, and I stumbled upon an interesting project - the [Zero Terminal](https://n-o-d-e.net/zeroterminal.html). Now we're talking. A Raspberry PI Zero packed with all sorts of ports and expansion capabilities. But waiting for it? I'm not the patient type...

But wait a minute! I always carry my [Samsung S20 Ultra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S20) anyway. Couldn't it serve all my needs? True, the battery life sucks. But as it is my cell phone, I always have it charged, so that shouldn't be a problem. And with my [small, foldable bluetooth keyboard](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33044680958.html?spm=2114.search0303.3.36.3e2f50e4kUuHVD&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_0,searchweb201603_0,ppcSwitch_0&algo_pvid=c05d6fa4-cb6c-4b28-aaa8-9da88e98cd0f&algo_expid=c05d6fa4-cb6c-4b28-aaa8-9da88e98cd0f-5), I have massive computing power with me at all times. An added benefit is that it can easily use a monitor or TV screen via the built-in <i>Smart View</i>.

The real kicker is that it runs VIM in all its galore - even with my [HyperList](https://isene.org/hyperlist/) plugin. It runs [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and my whole [Amar Tools](https://isene.org/2018/08/Amar-Tools.html) [package](https://github.com/isene/Amar-Tools). And [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) and [SSH](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/) and [Weechat](https://weechat.org/) and... you name it. Lots of terminal/console programs are readily available via [Termux](https://termux.com/).

But that's not all you can do. With the X Server app [XSDL](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=x.org.server&hl=en) and the [UserLand](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tech.ula&hl=en) app, you can in fact install a full Linux distro and fire it up on your Android phone. With the full glory of both terminals and graphical software. Run an [i3](https://i3wm.org/) session with [urxvt](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Rxvt-unicode) terminals running [zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/), [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/), [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) and whatnot. Now, that's Nerdvana!

So, from my HP-41, via the HP-200LX, the MC218 and looking at Zero Terminal, I found the answer right here in my pocket. Quite a detour. But ending in bliss :-)
