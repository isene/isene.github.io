I could boil everything I do down to one simple principle:

***Do that which helps - don't do that which doesn't help.***

The key to not having to clean up any mess is to not make a mess in the first place.

The key to not having to apologize for being stupid... is to not be stupid.

The solution to stress and being overworked is to stop taking on too many tasks.

Adding a negative emotion in a difficult situation is just dumb. It's like picking up a large stone halfway through an Olympic swimming contest.

Not messing up is easier and more effective than making genius moves. You don't always have to strive for perfection as long as you at least don't sabotage yourself.

When I am successful it's not primarily because I'm doing a lot of smart moves. It's because I avoid doing stupid shit.

I'm not at all advocating avoiding new terretories. You should always try new things and master the art of failing. I'm simply advocating not sabotaging yourself.

And I'm not yet excellent in applying these principles, but I'm constantly working on them. I am a work in progress.
