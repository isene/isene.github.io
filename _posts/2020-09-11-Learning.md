This week's webinar gave interesting angles on **learning** - learning
faster, slower, enjoying learning and why we should learn stuff.

Cathrine Skovli from our Facebook Group, "[Help without thought of
reward](https://www.facebook.com/groups/300454157896878)" is doing a
great job driving these webinars toward ever more interesting themes.
