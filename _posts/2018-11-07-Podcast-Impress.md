Yesterday I did a talk at the [Procurement 4.0 conference](http://info.deloitte.no/ev-2018-strategy-operations-osl-NIMA-Forum.html) at [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en.html?icid=site_selector_global) in Oslo. While the topic I covered was digitilization in shipping, I ended up recommending the audience to go home and ask their sexual partner how they could be the ideal partner in bed for them... and then deliver that and telling me how it went. I am curious if I will get any feedback. During the talk I covered the essence in [the OnePageBook "Impress!"](https://isene.org/onepagebooks/#1pb-10-impress) via the Arrow->Box->Arrow method. Listen to the podcast and I will take you through a drill using this method.
