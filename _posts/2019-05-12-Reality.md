My son Jonatan came home one day from kindergarden and asked "Daddy, do you believe in reality?" That sparked an interesting mind-popping session where we talked about the nature of reality, cosmology, quantum mechanics and free will. This was 10 years ago and he was 5. Jonatan has continued to challenge me and teach me.

I decided to put together my latest creative works into a video.

Jonatan, this is for you.

And then I added another instalment of artwork and music:
