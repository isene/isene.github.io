This podcast distills the OnePageBook, "[How to help a friend in trouble](https://isene.org/onepagebooks/#1pb-5-how-to-help-a-friend-in-trouble)" down to just one single effective tip. There exists a silver bullet in helping another. It may not be the tip a person wants to hear, but it is the tip he needs to hear. In the podcast, I give you a challenge. Are you up for it?
