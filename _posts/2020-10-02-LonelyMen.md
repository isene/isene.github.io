In this week's webinar from our Facebook Group, "[Help without thought of
reward](https://www.facebook.com/groups/300454157896878)", we covered the
subject "Men and loneliness". In many cultures this is topic is considered
taboo. As usual, we cover lots of ground - this time with our special guest,
Dexter Gelfand.
