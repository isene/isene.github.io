<p>Here are some neat updates for Game Masters of the <a href="http://d6gaming.org">Amar Role-Playing Game</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://d6gaming.org/index.php/GM%27s_Screen">A Game Master screen</a> can be made using a generic screen like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stratagem-Masters-4-Panel-Customizable-Inserts/dp/B06WLQP1SB">Stratagem The Master’s Tome Customizable GM Screen</a>. Just choose 4 of the 5 available panels, print out and insert them into the generic screen’s plastic sleeves. You’ll have a nice screen to hide all your Game Master secret from the players with all the important game tables right in front of you.</p>

<p>Then there are <a href="http://d6gaming.org/index.php/Mythology#Overview_of_the_Gods_and_their_Worshipping">the whole pantheon of Gods and Goddesses</a>. The mythological part of Amar has been updated to include all the major Deities as well as the most important lesser Deities. Each has a page describing the details, including the attributes of the God or Goddess, type of worship, Holy Day and more.</p>

<p>In addition I have included <a href="http://d6gaming.org/index.php/Campaign_tracker">a simple Campaign tracker</a> to make it easy for the GM to write down events during a game calendar year.</p>

<p>Happy role-playing :-)</p>
