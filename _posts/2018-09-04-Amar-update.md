Here are some neat updates for Game Masters of the [Amar Role-Playing Game](http://d6gaming.org).

![Amar GM Screen](https://isene.org/assets/posts/amar-gm-screen.png)

[A Game Master screen](http://d6gaming.org/index.php/GM%27s_Screen) can be made using a generic screen like the [Stratagem The Master's Tome Customizable GM Screen](https://www.amazon.com/Stratagem-Masters-4-Panel-Customizable-Inserts/dp/B06WLQP1SB). Just choose 4 of the 5 available panels, print out and insert them into the generic screen's plastic sleeves. You'll have a nice screen to hide all your Game Master secret from the players with all the important game tables right in front of you.

Then there are [the whole pantheon of Gods and Goddesses](http://d6gaming.org/index.php/Mythology#Overview_of_the_Gods_and_their_Worshipping). The mythological part of Amar has been updated to include all the major Deities as well as the most important lesser Deities. Each has a page describing the details, including the attributes of the God or Goddess, type of worship, Holy Day and more.

In addition I have included [a simple Campaign tracker](http://d6gaming.org/index.php/Campaign_tracker) to make it easy for the GM to write down events during a game calendar year.

Happy role-playing :-)
