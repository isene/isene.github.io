A talk on simplicity - in coaching, in life, in games, in the search for truth and free will. 

I pulled up the phone and my mini-mic and did this raw and personal talk in the woods. First take, no editing.

I cover some breaktroughs in coaching, my quest for free will and [the best improvement practice I've found so far](https://dexsessions.com/) and its contrast to the complex mess called Scientology.
