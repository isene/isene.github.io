[Brendan](https://www.brendanmartin.com/) has succinctly summed up what we do in three simple steps that will improve your life:

1. Be more interested
2. Give more plusses
3. Enjoy the game

I covered the first point in [an earlier blog post](https://isene.org/2018/09/Podcast-EasilyHurt.html). It is also covered in our OnePageBook, "[Mental training - The core](https://isene.org/onepagebooks/#1pb-2-mental-training---the-core)".

The second point is covered **[in several](https://isene.org/2018/11/Podcast-Impress.html)** [earlier](https://isene.org/2018/10/Podcast-HelpOthers.html) **[posts](https://isene.org/2018/12/Podcast-MeaningOfLife.html)**.

And the third point was the subject of [a post this summer](https://isene.org/2019/07/Enjoy.html).

The elegance of summing it all up in just three simple points is the genius of Brendan.
