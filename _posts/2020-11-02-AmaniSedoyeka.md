One of the most thoughtful and empathetic people I've ever met, [Amani
Sedoyeka](https://isene.me/2012/10/29/amazing-person-eliamani-sedoyeka-amani/)
is helping in any way he can. His family is highly respected because they are
highly effective in helping others without thought of reward.

Meet the amazing Amani and get inspired by his words, his actions.

Amani was the gateway to [an adventure that Brendan and I will never
forget](https://isene.me/2011/05/25/dont-touch-the-cows/).
