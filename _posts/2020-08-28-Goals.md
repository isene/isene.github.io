This week Cathrine Skovli from our Facebook Group, "[Help without thought of
reward](https://www.facebook.com/groups/300454157896878)" hosted another Zoom
session. This time on the subject of setting goals.

It could serve as a continuation of my earlier blog post, "[Do you actually
need your goals and ambitions?](https://isene.org/2018/10/Podcast-Ambitions.html)".

We cover the setting of goals from different angles and for many different
situations.

Thanks to Cathrine for the initiativ, to Brendan for his wisdom and to Brian
and Harry for joining in on the Zoom call.
