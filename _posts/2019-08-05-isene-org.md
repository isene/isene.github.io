Here's a neat little thing I just discovered: [Gource](https://gource.io/) - a software version control visualization tool

And I used it to create a visualization of the development of this site (isene.org) since I launched it as my new home last summer, using [Jekyll as my platform](https://isene.org/2018/08/Welcome.html):

<div class="youtube-wrapper">
<center><iframe src="https://isene.org/assets/videos/isene-org.mp4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
</div>

Just some summer geekery :-)
