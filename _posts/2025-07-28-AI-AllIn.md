I've been going all in with AI. Programming, artwork, music, philosophical research. All in.

Let me share the ride.

Programming first. Since May 1st, my babies have gotten massive upgrades. [RTFM](https://github.com/isene/RTFM) hit v6.0 with remote browsing, SSH integration, enhanced tab management. The file manager can now browse remote systems. And it's completely rewritten with rcurses My [Ruby shell](https://github.com/isene/rsh) (v2.9) got AI integration - just type @ or @@ to chat with AI right from the command line. [IMDB terminal](https://github.com/isene/IMDB) was also completely rewritten using rcurses and improved with TMDb integration. [Astropanel](https://github.com/isene/astropanel) now rocks the IAU 2006 obliquity standard - way more accurate. UI improvements and based on rcurses. [Telescope](https://github.com/isene/telescope) got tons of improvements. [XRPN](https://github.com/isene/xrpn) received critical bug fixes. [T-REX](https://github.com/isene/T-REX) now integrates with XRPN. And the foundation for most of these - [rcurses](https://github.com/isene/rcurses) - hit v5.0 with major improvements while keeping full backward compatibility. 

I've also build several larger projects from scratch that will soon come into public view - like a full movies/series database with AI suggestions for what to watch along where to find streaming providers to watch them, custom lists - private, public and shared with family and friends (like Spotify), and with tons of functionality. A multi-tenant chatbot solution was built from scratch in a week.

I saw one user on Reddit posting a date picker tool for the terminal that he had spent a year creating. It was really cool. With Claude Code I created something slightly better in less than 30 minutes; [datepick](https://github.com/isene/datepick).

Claude Code has been a really good tool. Like having a tireless coding companion who actually gets what you're trying to do.

But it's not just code. 

Music creation has exploded. Two new albums are out: [Spacesynth](https://open.spotify.com/album/2mO2Zhvp2B7pL8XLp0eJKK?si=RGz4NmX9TW61MyGAqr1Tag) and [Zanzibar](https://open.spotify.com/album/02giPJY03hetfGiaJt9jAR?si=LMNeWaLoTBCDd89vdm7-tg). You can preview the full Spacesynth album on [HearNow](https://isene.hearnow.com/). Both albums are on Apple Music, YouTube Music, and basically everywhere. Third album (Italo Disco) coming out in a couple of days.

The philosophical rabbit holes? Deep. Using AI as a sparring partner for exploring consciousness, free will and the nature of reality.

A few take-aways from going all in:
* AI doesn't replace creativity - it amplifies it
* The bottleneck isn't the tech, it's your imagination
* Good prompting is key (like I wrote in my [earlier post](https://isene.org/2025/05/AI.html))
* What works today will be outdated next week

If you're sitting on the fence - jump. The water's fine and getting finer every day.
