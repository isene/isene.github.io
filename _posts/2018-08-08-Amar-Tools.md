The swiss army knife tool set for the Amar Role-Playing game is [freely available on Github](https://github.com/isene/Amar-Tools/). Although created for the Amar RPG, these tools are useful for any fantasy RPG.

The online version is available here: [http://www.isene.org/amar.html](http://www.isene.org/amar.html)

A shortened version of the feature list:

- Generate random encounters in various terrains (day or night): The encounters are of various races, complete with random names, sex, stats and attitude towards the player characters. You can download the generated encounters as a text file.
