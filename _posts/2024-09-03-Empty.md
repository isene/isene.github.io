It won't get simpler than this.
 
In mathematics, the empty set is a set that does not contain any values
or elements. It is expressed as { } or the Greek letter âˆ… (phi). It is also
known as the null set or void set. It is the building block for all sets of
anything in mathematics. 

When I asked ChatGPT for its take on the empty set, it came out with the usual
mathematical definitions. It also said this:

> **Potentiality**: The empty set could also be interpreted as representing potential - the state before anything exists, where any possibility could emerge. It's a foundational concept that underpins the idea that more complex structures (sets with elements) can be built from simpler ones (starting with nothing).

In short, nothing is simpler than the empty set. It's one Nothing, a pure
Potential.

I see only three fundamental concepts of value - zero, one or infinite. Since
I've had zero tattoos so far in life - and it would be impossible to have an
infinite of them - I decided to have one. Just one. One that means nothing.

It represents my current quest - beyond my previous published work on free
will - that of potential or cause. I see that as the real distinction between
artificial intelligence and you. While AI is an algorithm and unable to
actually cause any change, you are able to affect change, since you - at the
core - is Potential, Cause. You are the empty set. It won't get any simpler.
