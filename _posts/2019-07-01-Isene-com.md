I've had the pleasure working more closely with a truly great guy the past few weeks - Øivind Haugland. He's an excellent sounding board and he gets me thinking. Like what the exact value of what I do really is. And it boils down to this: Making Everything Simpler.

Like [HyperList](https://isene.org/hyperlist) for structuring information in a simpler way. Or the [OnePageBooks](https://isene.org/onepagebooks). Or my explorations of [Free Will](https://isene.org/freewill). These are all efforts to simplify.

Whenever I do projects, coach people, write, make art or music, I try to simplify the process and the results.
