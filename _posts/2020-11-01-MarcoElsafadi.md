In this webinar, we have Marco Elsafadi as our guest. He has been working
with some pretty tough teenagers and has managed to crack the code on how
to get under their skin and truly help them. His tips are relevant for 
how to relate to any youth - whether you are a father, mother, teacher,
coach, grandparent or in any position where you are helping young people.
