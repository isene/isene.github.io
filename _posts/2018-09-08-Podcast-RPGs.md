Have you seen the movie [E.T.](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083866/?ref_=nv_sr_1) or the Netflix series [Stranger Things](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4574334/?ref_=nv_sr_1)? Then you probably have some idea of what Role-Playing Games are. In this podcast I give a 20 minute introduction to RPGs in general and the [Amar RPG](http://d6gaming.org) in particular. Get into the fun and excitement of adventure and creating stories together with your friends.
