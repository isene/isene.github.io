After learning to program when I was 13, I soon started to design my own programming language. But I didn't have the skills to implement it, and the project was soon forgotten.

Until a few weeks ago. I remembered - and got the spark again.

After about 50 hours of coding, I'm proud to announce XRPN - a stack-based programming language in the spirit of Forth and Postscript. It covers a lot of ground with more than 250 functions and with extensibility on the fly, indirect addressing and the opportunity to easily write self-modifying code.

It's been a lot of fun. And I hope the fun continues. And the fun is fueled with some user feedback ï¿¼
