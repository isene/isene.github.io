Do you possess free will? Can you actually freely choose? Do you have any choice at all?

Here you will find my explorations into this fascinating subject:
1. Listen to my very short [podcast on free will](/2018/09/Podcast-FreeWill.html)
2. Read the OnePageBook, "[Free will](/onepagebooks/#1pb-3-free-will)"
3. Read the article, "[On Will](https://www.dropbox.com/s/061keir0a0hacf5/onwill.pdf?raw=1)"
4. Then [contact me](/about/) for a mutually interesting discussion on free will
