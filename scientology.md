If you came here to read about my viewpoints on Scientology, you will find everything from this one page.

### Intro
I left the Church of Scientology on 2009-08-07. See [my detailed write-up on why](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tf00555uzqh7lnn/GeirIseneDoubtCoS.pdf?raw=1).

It boiled down to personal integrity. I could no longer be part of an organization where the management is lying, harassing and suppressing the free will of its members.

Although [I am not a Scientologist](http://isene.wordpress.com/2011/09/29/i-am-not-a-scientologist/), I believe that the Scientology philosophy contain some [valuable](http://elysianchakorta.wordpress.com/2009/08/18/the-good/) and [helpful](https://isene.me/2018/05/13/thanks-to-scientology/) methods.

My old [Scientology blog](http://elysianchakorta.wordpress.com) has detailed accounts covering my experiences in the Church of Scientology and the first year after I left.

To start off, here is a podcast that answers the question, "What is Scientology?". It's Episode 3 of "Geir's Everything" - available on all major podcast platforms. In this episode I cover the basics of Scientology:

### Books
Some 6 months after I left, I compiled all my blog posts into a book called "[Six months in the open](http://www.scribd.com/doc/64406625/Six-Months-In-The-Open-Scientology)" (Scribd.com). Link to [direct download ](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dajp4utk9lj9u33/sixmonths.pdf?raw=1)(91 pages, 1.6 MB).

Then, in May 2013, I compiled all the Scientology-related posts from this blog into the book called "From Independent Scientologist to just me". Get [it at Scribd.com](http://www.scribd.com/doc/144031292/From-Independent-Scientologist-to-just-me). Or [download it right here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5240ln4nhspd7j4/justme.pdf?raw=1) (291 pages, 5.4 MB).

In 2013, my book titled, "[Nittenåttifire](https://isene.me/1984-book/)" was published in Norwegian by the publisher, [Humanist forlag](https://www.humanistforlag.no/).
